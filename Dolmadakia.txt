Dolmadakia

Ingredients:
1 bowl of rice
500 gr (lb) minced meat
some mint
some parsley
pinch of cinnamon
pepper and salt to taste
paprika powder to taste
2 medium onions
4 cloves of garlic
some oil for frying
1 jar of vine leaves
1 or 1/2 cup lemon juice to taste.

Preparation:
Rinse the vine leaves, if necessary place them in boiling water.
Pour water into the bowl of rice.
Cut the onions and garlic into small cubes. Fry briefly in a large pan.
Add minced meat to the onions and garlic.
While minced meat is cooking, cut the mint leaves and parsley.
Throttle off. Add mint leaves and parsley to the minced meat mixture.
Add the pepper, salt, cinnamon, paprika, rice and finally lemon juice.
Mix everything well. Cover the pan and let it stand.
Sort vine leaves by damaged and undamaged. Repair the damaged one if 
necessary or set it aside to use as a bottom cover in a new pan for the dolmas.
Then stuff vine leaves. Place them close together in the pan so that they do 
not float and roll apart later on. Place some damaged vine leaves between two 
layers to make it easier to scoop the dolmas out of the pan later.
After the last layer of dolmas add water to the pan, the 11olmas should just 
be submerged. Plate on top so they don't float and roll apart.
Cook for about 45 minutes.
